Practice with Regular Expressions, Unit Testing, and shell commands

We created a simple function that would parse an inserted name, take the name given and then rearrange the name so thtat the last name would be first and the first name would be last.

We completed this functions using the imported regular expressions module and regular expressions, loops and formating strings

for the testing we used the unit test module and built our test from inheritance and class syntax.
